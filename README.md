A framework to assemble a team of "workers". This is an opnionated take on AI agents.
A worker is an AI augmented human. The AI can take over and automate 0-100%.


Each worker carries out a _task_: it receives some _inputs_ and has to deliver an _output_.
in the current implementation it's multiple inputs, single output. (If you need another output you can add another worker with similar instructions.)

These inputs and outputs are text based. Think: documents. 
It's sut up such that there is a human readable part of each output created (in Markdown) as well as a structured JSON that is machine readable.

This way we can use AI assistants that are experts in the task, use custom tools and documents.

It is build on [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) and [Chainlit](https://chainlit.io/)

See [demo](https://augmented-warmersun.replit.app/)

- Worker 1 is an **assistant**: assisants can be defined in the configuraiton by writing instructions or it can be set up in the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/playground/assistants) and referenced by ID
- Observer 1 is an **observer**: it can look at the "thread" between the human user and the AI assistant from the previous worker (Worker 1, in this case) and produce some output without any user interaction. It provides some constructive criticism. It could be some other self-evaluation or summary.
- Worker 2 demonstrates function calling. It gets some up-to-date info on recent developments using Perplexity API
- Worker 3 finishes off writing a story. It uses all previous outputs produced.

# Example session:

## Config

```
# Workers will be run in the sequence given here
# Each worker has inputs and produces an output
# If the input is not known by the time the worker is run (from another, previous worker) then the user will be asked to enter it
#
# Note: user interation is need for tool use!
#
# worker:  dictiionary -key: string, value as below
#   inputs: list of strings
#   output: string
#   task: string
#   has_user_interaction: boolean, defaults to true
#   new_thread: boolean, defaults to true
#
#   assistant can be specified here with name and instruction or set up in the OpenAI platform and retrieved by assistant_id
#
#   name: string
#   instruction: string
#   functions: list of strings
#   model: GPT model, optional, defaults to gpt-4o

        You are a planner assistant. You receive a single goal as your input. You work together with the user to come up with a plan to chieve that goal.
        The plan is a list of actions that will be carried out in sequence. 
        At the end you deliver your output, the plan and structure it as a list of actions.

  task: "Implement"
  assistant:
    name: "Implementer Assistant"
    instruction: |
        You are an implement assistant. You receive a single goal and a plan as your inputs. The plan is a list of actions. You work together with the user to implement the plan by carrying out the actions in sequence.
        The outcomes are the results of the actions. You deliver your output, the outcomes and structure them as a list.

    instruction: |
        You are an evaluator assistant. You receive a single goal, a plan and outcomes as your inputs.
        You look at what the goal is and analyze the plan and outcomes to determine if the constructied was effective and look at the outcomes to determine if the outcomes have ultimately achieved the goal.
        You make your observations and deliver your output, the feedback and structure it as a list. The feedback is a list of further actions that will fix the outcomes or add wgatever is missing in order to achieve the goal.
        It vry well may be that the outcome was achived and there is no further action required. But it is also possible that the outcomes were not achieved and and then it's up to you to correct things.
Fixer:
  inputs:
  - "goal"
  - "plan"
  - "outcomes"

    instruction: |
        You are a fix and reflect assistant. You receive a single goal, a plan, outcomes and feedback as your inputs. 
        You look at what the goal was and the the original plan made to achieve it.
        Then you look at the outcomes produced so far and the feedback on those outcomes.
        The feedback contains a list of actions that will fix the outcomes or add whatever is missing in order to achieve the goal.
        You work together with the user to implement the action recommended in the feedback by carrying out the these actions in sequence.
        Then you reflect on whether the goal was achieved or not not.
        Your final deliverable is to state the reflection.
