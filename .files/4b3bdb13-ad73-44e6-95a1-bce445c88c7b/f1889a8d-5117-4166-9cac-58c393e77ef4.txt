### Lesson Plan: The Great October Revolution of 1917

#### 1. Introduction
**Goal**: To introduce the students to the main figures and reasons behind the October Revolution and its historical context.

#### 2. Background: Russia before the Revolution

**Key Points**:
- **Tsar Nicholas II**: The last Emperor of Russia, ruling from 1894 until his abdication in 1917.
- **State of Russia**: Under Tsar Nicholas II, Russia was suffering from vast inequalities, a rigid class system, and involvement in World War I which exacerbated economic misery and widespread dissatisfaction.
- **Economic Hardships**: The economy was struggling, leading to food shortages, poor working conditions, and low wages.

**Activity**: Show photographs and discuss what life might have been like for a common person in Russia during this time. Students can write a short diary entry from the perspective of a Russian peasant or worker.

#### 3. Rise of Revolutionary Ideas

**Key Points**:
- **Karl Marx's Influence**: Learn about Marxist ideology and how it appealed to the struggling working class.
- **Socialist Parties**: Introduce the main socialist parties, primarily the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.

**Activity**: Role-play a debate between a Bolshevik and a Menshevik, focusing on their differing approaches to revolution.

#### 4. Key Figures

**Lenin**:
- Full Name: Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, known as Lenin.
- **Role**: Leader of the Bolshevik Party, a revolutionary leader who championed the fight against the Tsarist regime.
- **Beliefs**: Advocated for a proletariat-led (working class) revolution to overthrow the existing monarchy and bourgeoisie control.

**Tsar Nicholas II**:
- **Role**: The autocratic ruler whose inability to manage the nation’s problems led to growing discontent.
- **Downfall**: His abdication in March 1917 opened the way for the Bolsheviks to seize power.

**Activity**: Present a brief biography of Lenin and Tsar Nicholas II, followed by a discussion on how their personal characteristics and decisions influenced the course of the revolution.

#### 5. Trigger for the October Revolution

**Key Points**:
- **February Revolution**: In March 1917 (February in the Julian calendar), massive protests led to Tsar Nicholas II’s abdication and the establishment of a provisional government.
- **Weak Provisional Government**: The provisional government failed to address key issues like war, land reforms, and economic instability, leading to continued unrest.

**Activity**: Have students create a timeline of major events from the February Revolution to the October Revolution to visualize the rapid changes during this period.

#### 6. The October Revolution

**Key Points**:
- **10-26 October 1917**: The Bolshevik Party, led by Lenin, orchestrated a well-planned uprising depicting the capture of key government locations in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg).
- **Bolsheviks Take Power**: The provisional government was overthrown during the storming of the Winter Palace, and the Bolsheviks took control.

**Visual Aids**: Use primary source images or reenactment videos to help students visualize the events.

**Activity**: Group project to create a newspaper front page from October 26, 1917, announcing the Bolshevik takeover, including headlines, main story, and an editorial perspective.

#### 7. Why Did People Revolt?

**Key Points**:
- **Economic Disparity**: Extreme poverty for the peasants and workers juxtaposed with the opulence of the aristocracy.
- **War Fatigue**: Continuous involvement in WWI leading to military failures and sufferings.
- **Political Discontent**: The desire for more representation and better living conditions from the working and middle classes.

**Discussion Topic**: How do economic conditions and war contribute to political revolutions? Students can compare these situations to other historical or current events.

**Activity**: Write a short essay on why they think the October Revolution was successful. What were the pivotal factors that made the revolution possible?

### Stories

#### 1. The Train Ride that Changed History

In the spring of 1917, Vladimir Lenin was living in exile in Switzerland. The February Revolution had just happened, the Tsar had abdicated, and Russia was in turmoil with a Provisional Government struggling to maintain order. Lenin knew this was his moment, but he needed to get back to Russia as soon as possible.

Here’s where the story takes an interesting twist: crossing war-torn Europe during World War I wasn’t exactly simple. Many European borders were closed, and travel was dangerous. However, Lenin was persistent and strategic. He negotiated with the German government, which agreed to allow him safe passage through their territory. The Germans hoped that Lenin’s return would further destabilize Russia, which would be advantageous to them in the war.

The train ride itself was the stuff of legend. Lenin and his fellow revolutionaries traveled in a sealed train car — yes, sealed, to prevent any potential political contamination. It was a long journey, filled with apprehension and hope.

Imagine this: Lenin, a man who had spent years honing his revolutionary ideas, was now racing back to Russia, reading, writing, and planning intensively during the journey. The train crossed Germany, then into Sweden and Finland, before finally arriving in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) in April 1917.

When Lenin stepped off that train, he was energized and ready to lead. He gave an impassioned speech at Finland Station, calling for an immediate end to the Provisional Government and urging the transfer of power to the soviets (workers' councils).

This moment was pivotal. His return set the stage for the October Revolution and the eventual Bolshevik takeover. The sealed train journey symbolized not just the physical travel of Lenin back to Russia, but also the transport of revolutionary ideas that would reshape an empire and, ultimately, the world.

**Activity**:
- **Discussion Prompt**: Why do you think Lenin’s train journey became such a pivotal moment in history? What might have happened if Lenin had not made it back to Russia?
- **Creative Assignment**: Ask students to write a diary entry from Lenin's perspective during the train journey, reflecting on his thoughts, hopes, and strategies for the impending revolution.

#### 2. The Family Man in the Winter Palace

Tsar Nicholas II was born into a world of unimaginable opulence and power. Yet, despite his regal surroundings, he was a deeply family-oriented man and a devoted father, qualities that, some argue, both humanized and hindered him as a ruler.

One poignant story about Nicholas II took place during the winter of 1916, when the royal family was still residing in the lavish Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Despite the grandeur of his residence, Nicholas was often withdrawn and preoccupied, spending much of his time with his wife, Tsarina Alexandra, and their five children: Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and the youngest, Alexei, who suffered from hemophilia.

On cold winter nights, Nicholas often read bedtime stories to his children, a duty he cherished above his royal obligations. One evening, while reading a particularly engaging story to Alexei, an urgent message arrived from his advisors. The news was dire: revolts were spreading, food shortages were causing unrest, and soldiers were deserting the army. The country was on the brink of revolution.

Yet, instead of rushing to address these critical issues, Nicholas delayed his response to finish the story and ensure his son was comforted and asleep. This small but telling moment revealed a significant aspect of Nicholas' character—his deep love for his family often led him to overlook the pressing demands of his empire. His priorities, though noble in a personal sense, often clashed with the harsh realities and responsibilities of ruling a country in crisis.

This inclination to place his family’s wellbeing above state affairs was one of the many factors that led to his downfall. His inability to grasp the severity of the public’s suffering and to act decisively when it mattered most, coupled with his isolation within the royal bubble, estranged him from his people. The once-revered ruler became increasingly viewed as out-of-touch and ineffective.

Ultimately, this familial devotion and detachment from his royal duties contributed to the erosion of his authority. By the time he abdicated in March 1917, it was too late to salvage his reign or the monarchy.

**Activity**:
- **Discussion Prompt**: How do you think Nicholas II's dedication to his family influenced his ability to lead Russia? Can personal qualities that are good in one context be detrimental in another?
- **Creative Assignment**: Have students write a diary entry from the perspective of one of Nicholas' advisors on the night he delayed attending to urgent state matters for a bedtime story. What might the advisor have felt and thought in that moment?
